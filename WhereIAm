I can't get the blast devise views to be recognized. 
I think it is because I need to add the sign in/ up pages to my routes.
Might could google other people's examples of Devise (could use bloc projects)

These are the sites I have open now.

I am wandering if the user_id I generated to Foreign Key between References and Users works. If I have problems later on, check that out.
